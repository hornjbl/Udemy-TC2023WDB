## Section 5 - Introduction to CSS

-   CSS = Cascading Style Sheets
-   CSS can be added in three ways:
    -   inline - added inside the actual element to be styled.
    -   internal - added in the &lt;style&gt; tag, usually in the &lt;head&gt; section.
    -   external - added in a separate .css file.
